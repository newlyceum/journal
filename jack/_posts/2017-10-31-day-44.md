Things to write about:

* What did you study and work on today? Be sure to write down everything you did and the subjects (English, Math, Health, Social Studies, Science).
* How many books did you finish since your last journal entry? **Record the number** and write what they were.
* Did you do any music or crafts?
* HAPPY HALLOWEEN! What do you like most about Halloween?

Today I finished all my english except my story, which I will do friday. I also worked on some science.


What I like most about halloween is trick-or-treating and staring at all the loot, and then getting home and eating it.
