Things to write about:

* What did you study and work on today? Be sure to write down everything you did and the subjects (English, Math, Health, Social Studies, Science).
* How many books did you finish since your last journal entry? **Record the number** and write what they were.
* Did you do any music or crafts?
* **Did you do anything noteworthy over the weekend?**

***

Today I corrected work that I had done in the past. In science I did a three paragraph report on bats. It required lots of research.

I made part of my halloween costume over the weekend. (Or was that last weekend?)
