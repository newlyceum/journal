MONDAY: Today for Social Studies I looked at KOA campgrounds for my road trip, made an idea web for my road trip, and marked my road trip destinations on my map. TUESDAY: Today for Science I did an experiment with paper, illutrated and wrote about the perfect plane, and made paper airplanes and explained which one flew best.
